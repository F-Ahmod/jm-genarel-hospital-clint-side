        Each day, 1500 people visit our 450 inpatients. Our hospital  has many inpatients with complex medical conditions who are  prone to infection. It is our duty to protect our patients  from infection as well as ensure proper rest for them. Our  current visitors’ policy allows up to 2 visitors per patient  at any one time during visiting hours.
          </p>

       Clinical Briefing <br />

       <h5 className="ps-2 text-light">MORNING    : 9.30 am to 10.30 am
       AFTERNOON    : 5.30 pm to 7.00 pm</h5>
       <br /><br /><br />
       <p className="ps-2 text-light">We urge you to avoid bringing children below 07 years old to the hospital. This is in the interest of their safety as they are more vulnerable to infection. Persons who are unwell must not visit any patient.

        Appropriate arrangements can be made separately for patients   who need more immediate relatives present for meeting with our   healthcare professionals and for patients who are critically   ill.

       We seek your understanding that it is necessary for us to be cautious and vigilant so that a high volume of visitors to our wards will not pose a health risk to our patients.
       <br /><br />
        Thank you for your co-operation in helping us to keep our patients, your loved ones, safe.</p>
